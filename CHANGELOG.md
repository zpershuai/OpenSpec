# @fission-ai/openspec

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- [#502](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/pull/502) [`9db74aa`](https://github.com/Fission-AI/OpenSpec/commit/9db74aa5ac6547efadaed795217cfa17444f2004) Thanks [@TabishB](https://github.com/TabishB)! - ### New Features

  - **`/opsx:verify` command** — Validate that change implementations match their specifications

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed vitest process storms by capping worker parallelism
  - Fixed agent workflows to use non-interactive mode for validation commands
  - Fixed PowerShell completions generator to remove trailing commas

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- eb152eb: ### New Features

  - **Continue IDE support** – OpenSpec now generates slash commands for [Continue](https://continue.dev/), expanding editor integration options alongside Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Code, and others
  - **Shell completions for Bash, Fish, and PowerShell** – Run `openspec completion install` to set up tab completion in your preferred shell
  - **`/opsx:explore` command** – A new thinking partner mode for exploring ideas and investigating problems before committing to changes
  - **Codebuddy slash command improvements** – Updated frontmatter format for better compatibility

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Shell completions now correctly offer parent-level flags (like `--help`) when a command has subcommands
  - Fixed Windows compatibility issues in tests

  ### Other

  - Added optional anonymous usage statistics to help understand how OpenSpec is used. This is **opt-out** by default – set `OPENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` to disable. Only command names and version are collected; no arguments, file paths, or content. Automatically disabled in CI environments.

## 0.17.2

### Patch Changes

- 455c65f: Fix `--no-interactive` flag in validate command to properly disable spinner, preventing hangs in pre-commit hooks and CI environments

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- a2757e7: Fix pre-commit hook hang issue in config command by using dynamic import for @inquirer/prompts

  The config command was causing pre-commit hooks to hang indefinitely due to stdin event listeners being registered at module load time. This fix converts the static import to a dynamic import that only loads inquirer when the `config reset` command is actually used interactively.

  Also adds ESLint with a rule to prevent static @inquirer imports, avoiding future regressions.
