## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: OPSX Onboard Skill

The system SHALL provide an `/opsx:onboard` skill that guides users through their first complete OpenSpec workflow cycle with narration and real codebase work.

#### Scenario: Skill invocation

- **WHEN** user invokes `/opsx:onboard`
- **THEN** agent checks if OpenSpec is initialized
- **AND** if not initialized, prompts user to run `openspec init` first
- **AND** if initialized, proceeds with onboarding flow

#### Scenario: Welcome and expectations

- **WHEN** onboarding begins
- **THEN** agent displays welcome message explaining what will happen
- **AND** sets expectation of ~15 minute duration
- **AND** explains the workflow phases: explore → new → artifacts → apply → archive

### Requirement: Codebase Analysis for Task Suggestions

The skill SHALL analyze the user's codebase to suggest appropriately-scoped starter tasks.

#### Scenario: Codebase scanning

- **WHEN** onboarding reaches task selection phase
- **THEN** agent scans codebase for small improvement opportunities
- **AND** looks for: TODO/FIXME comments, missing error handling, functions without tests, outdated dependencies, type: any in TypeScript, console.log in production code, missing input validation
- **AND** checks recent git commits for context on current work

#### Scenario: Task suggestion presentation

- **WHEN** agent has analyzed codebase
- **THEN** agent presents 3-4 specific task suggestions with scope estimates
- **AND** each suggestion includes: task description, estimated scope (files/lines), why it's a good starter
- **AND** offers option for user to specify their own task

#### Scenario: Scope guardrail

- **WHEN** user selects or describes a task that is too large
- **THEN** agent gently redirects toward smaller scope
- **AND** suggests breaking down or deferring the large task
- **AND** offers appropriately-sized alternatives

### Requirement: Explore Phase Demo

The skill SHALL briefly demonstrate explore mode before creating a change.

#### Scenario: Brief explore demonstration

- **WHEN** task is selected
- **THEN** agent briefly demonstrates `/opsx:explore` by investigating relevant code
- **AND** explains explore mode is for thinking before doing
- **AND** keeps this phase short (not a full exploration session)
- **AND** transitions to change creation

### Requirement: Guided Artifact Creation

The skill SHALL guide users through each artifact with narration explaining the purpose.

#### Scenario: Change creation with narration

- **WHEN** creating the change directory
- **THEN** agent runs `openspec new change "<name>"` with derived kebab-case name
- **AND** explains what a "change" is (container for thinking and planning)
- **AND** shows the folder structure that was created
- **AND** pauses for user acknowledgment before proceeding

#### Scenario: Proposal creation with narration

- **WHEN** creating proposal.md
- **THEN** agent explains proposals capture WHY we're making this change
- **AND** drafts proposal based on selected task
- **AND** shows draft to user for approval before saving
- **AND** explains the sections (Why, What Changes, Capabilities, Impact)

#### Scenario: Specs creation with narration

- **WHEN** creating spec files
- **THEN** agent explains specs define WHAT we're building in detail
- **AND** explains the requirement/scenario format
- **AND** creates spec file(s) based on proposal capabilities
- **AND** notes that specs become documentation that stays in sync

#### Scenario: Design creation with narration

- **WHEN** creating design.md
- **THEN** agent explains design captures HOW we'll build it
- **AND** notes this is where technical decisions and tradeoffs live
- **AND** for small changes, acknowledges design may be brief
- **AND** creates design based on proposal and specs

#### Scenario: Tasks creation with narration

- **WHEN** creating tasks.md
- **THEN** agent explains tasks break work into checkboxes
- **AND** explains these drive the apply phase
- **AND** generates task list from design and specs
- **AND** shows tasks and asks if ready to implement

### Requirement: Guided Implementation

The skill SHALL implement tasks with narration connecting back to artifacts.

#### Scenario: Implementation with narration

- **WHEN** implementing tasks
- **THEN** agent announces each task before working on it
- **AND** implements the change in the codebase
- **AND** occasionally references how specs/design informed decisions
- **AND** marks each task complete as it finishes
- **AND** keeps narration light (not over-explaining)

#### Scenario: Implementation completion

- **WHEN** all tasks are complete
- **THEN** agent announces completion
- **AND** summarizes what was done
- **AND** transitions to archive phase

### Requirement: Archive with Explanation

The skill SHALL archive the completed change and explain what happened.

#### Scenario: Archive with narration

- **WHEN** archiving the change
- **THEN** agent explains archive moves change to dated folder
- **AND** runs archive process
- **AND** shows where archived change lives
- **AND** explains the long-term value (finding decisions later)

### Requirement: Recap and Next Steps

The skill SHALL conclude with a recap and command reference.

#### Scenario: Final recap

- **WHEN** onboarding is complete
- **THEN** agent summarizes the workflow phases completed
- **AND** emphasizes this rhythm works for any size change
- **AND** provides command reference table (/opsx:explore, /opsx:new, /opsx:ff, /opsx:continue, /opsx:apply, /opsx:verify, /opsx:archive)
- **AND** suggests next actions (try /opsx:new or /opsx:ff on something)

### Requirement: Graceful Exit Handling

The skill SHALL handle users who want to stop mid-way.

#### Scenario: User wants to stop

- **WHEN** user indicates they want to stop during onboarding
- **THEN** agent acknowledges gracefully
- **AND** notes that the in-progress change is saved
- **AND** explains how to continue later with `/opsx:continue <name>`
- **AND** exits without pressure

#### Scenario: User wants quick reference only

- **WHEN** user says they just want to see the commands
- **THEN** agent provides command cheat sheet
- **AND** exits gracefully with encouragement to try `/opsx:new`
