  Tech stack: TypeScript, Node.js (≥20.19.0), ESM modules
  Package manager: pnpm
  CLI framework: Commander.js

  Cross-platform requirements:
  - This tool runs on macOS, Linux, AND Windows
  - Always use path.join() or path.resolve() for file paths - never hardcode slashes
  - Never assume forward-slash path separators
  - Tests must use path.join() for expected path values, not hardcoded strings
  - Consider case sensitivity differences in file systems

rules:
  specs:
    - Include scenarios for Windows path handling when dealing with file paths
    - Requirements involving paths must specify cross-platform behavior
  tasks:
    - Add Windows CI verification as a task when changes involve file paths
    - Include cross-platform testing considerations
  design:
    - Document any platform-specific behavior or limitations
    - Prefer Node.js path module over string manipulation for paths
